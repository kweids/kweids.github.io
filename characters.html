            <h3>Timmy</h3>
            <div class="charac_image">

            </div>
            <p>Timothy "Timmy" Tiberius Turner is the main character of the show The Fairly OddParents. He originally had two fairy godparents, Cosmo and Wanda, but since Cosmo and Wanda's son Poof was born (Fairly Odd Baby), he now has three fairies and instead of Cosmo and Wanda being his fairy godparents, and Poof being his godbrother, they are now his fairy family. Timmy sometimes likes to make extreme wishes. His favorite super hero is the Crimson Chin, and likes to read the Crimson Chin comic books. As a result, his superhero alter- ego is also the Chin's sidekick, Cleft the Boy Chin Wonder. Timmy also sometimes breaks Da Rules, but tricks Jorgen Von Strangle into giving him back his fairy godparents.</p>
            <p>Timmy wears a pink hat which matches his shirt, and has blue pants and shoes. His hair is colored brown. He has blue colored eyes and buck teeth. He, along with his friends Chester and A.J., are considered unpopular at school. One thing that remains true for Timmy throughout his life are his buck teeth. It was shown in "The Good Old Days!" that his grandfather, Pappy, allowed Timmy to suck on his pacifier too long, causing him to develop his signature buck teeth. Timmy never appears to get his teeth fixed, as he carries his even into his adult life.</p>

            <h3>Cosmo</h3>
            <div class="charac_image">
                <img src="images/cosmo.png">
            </div>
            <p>Cosmo Julius Cosma is Timmy Turner and Chloe Carmichael's current fairy godfather. Along with his wife, Wanda, he was tasked with making miserable human children happy by granting them wishes and keeping them safe. Unfortunately, due to Cosmo's immense lack of intelligence, he often puts Timmy in danger with his wishes or misinterprets the wording of a wish and grants it wrong, wreaking havoc.</p>
            <p>Despite his low I.Q. and carefree attitude, he really does love his wife and his godchildren. It is hard for him to be apart from Wanda, and he gets extremely jealous when other men (particularly Juandissimo) flirt with her. He often goes along with Timmy's wishes, unlike Wanda who is a little strict about them. He and Wanda eventually have a child named Poof.</p>

            <h3>Wanda</h3>
            <div class="charac_image">
                <img src="images/wanda.png">
            </div>
            <p>Wanda Venus Fairywinkle-Cosma is the tritagonist of The Fairly OddParents alongside her husband Cosmo. Bright and compassionate, Wanda loves her new godchild Timmy just as much as she loves her son, Poof, and husband Cosmo. She is also the most responsible out of the bunch. </p>
            <p>She is often blamed for the misadventures that she and her family get themselves into by Jorgen von Strangle, who says she should take care to watch them better because of Cosmo's dangerous stupidity. She always loses to Cosmo when it comes to second guessing what Timmy wants to do, usually because Timmy wants to do something fun or destructive. She was apparently very popular in high school.</p>
        
            <h3>Poof</h3>
            <div class="charac_image">
                <img src="images/poof.png">
            </div>
            <p>Poof Fairywinkle-Cosma is the son of Cosmo and Wanda, whose most notable spoken word is "Poof", which Timmy decides upon as his name. He was wished up by Timmy as Cosmo and Wanda were desperate for a child of their own. He has one dark purple hair tress and purple eyes. He wears a light purple shirt with a black x-out and white slippers. Also, he is the only fairy baby in existence, and he is round unlike anti-fairy babies who are square.</p>

            <h3>Sparky</h3>
            <div class="charac_image">
                <img src="images/sparky.png">
            </div>
            <p>Sparky is a hyperactive fairy dog that became Timmy Turner's pet. He first appeared in the episode, "Fairly OddPet." He was adopted by Timmy, who wanted a dog after realizing everyone in Dimmsdale had a pet but him, but as he was banned from all the pet stores of the town, he had to adopt a dog from Fairy World.</p>

            <h3>Chloe</h3>
            <div class="charac_image">
                <img src="images/chloe.png">
            </div>
            <p>Chloe Carmichael is Timmy's neighbor and one of the main cast members for Season 10. She is Cosmo and Wanda's godchild alongside Timmy Turner, due to a shortage of Fairy Godparents being available to children. She is an over-achieving and enthusiastic girl, born on March 21st, the same day as Timmy. She tends to wish for things that may help people or be nice to them. Her favorite TV show is The Fair Bears, a parody of the Care Bears that speaks about being nice to others and to always be fair. Her birthday is the one day a year she puts herself over others, becoming obsessed with being the center of attention on that day similarly to Timmy.</p>

            <h3>Vicky</h3>
            <div class="charac_image">
                <img src="images/vicky.png">
            </div>
            <p>Vicky is a callous, sadistic, ruthless sixteen-year-old girl who babysits Timmy and the secondary antagonist of the show. Her really menacing behavior towards Timmy is one of the reasons - if not the main reason - that he has fairy godparents, and most of his wishes involve getting revenge, or simply getting around her. Vicky is typically hired when Timmy's parents make a hasty getaway trip to one of their "adults-only" destinations, leaving Timmy in her cruel hands. </p>
            <p>Vicky is a very two-faced person, when it comes to adults (namely parents), she seems like a sweet girl who has a continuous liking for cash, but once the parents are gone, her true colors are revealed. She tortures Timmy so quickly that it takes one second to wreck the place and knowing that Timmy's parents are nitwits, it's easy to fool them. Timmy has always wanted payback and has always wanted to get rid of her, but whenever this dream comes true, Timmy must always revert it as something will always appear or chime in to make Timmy realize he actually needs her (such as his parents hiring a worse babysitter). The parents of children and other rich people pay her wads of cash through her babysitting. She has been transformed more times than any other human except Timmy Turner.</p>

            <h3>Mr. Crooker</h3>
            <div class="charac_image">
                <img src="images/crocker.png">
            </div>
            <p>C. Denzel Quincy Crocker is the mentally unstable 40 year old school teacher of Timmy. Although most adults, even those as dumb as Timmy's parents, simply don't believe that fairies exist, Crocker believes otherwise as he has once before had Fairy God Parents, and before losing them, left a note to himself that they existed. He has an uncle, Albert, who’s obsessed with genies. Crocker has been shunned by his colleagues and students alike, and yet despite his clumsiness, he's one of the smartest characters on the show. He has correctly second-guessed Timmy's usage of his fairies a number of times, and has invented a number of devices that can actually sense magic and fairies, although they are usually destroyed by either Timmy, Cosmo, Wanda or Poof.</p>

            <h3>Dad</h3>
            <div class="charac_image">
                <img src="images/dad.png">
            </div>
            <p>Mr. Turner, also most commonly known as Dad and called simply "Turner" in "Dimmsdale Tales " is Timmy's father. Timmy's parents are a little off (literally), off to dinner, off to the movies, off who knows where, leaving Timmy at the mercy of his evil babysitter, Vicky who’s oblivious to the fact that she's evil (even when it is obvious). After all, just because they have a son doesn't mean they can't see themselves as more important than him. Mr. Turner is a tall man wearing office shirts and pants with a necktie and a belt. He works at Pencil Nexus, a pencil factory calling himself a pencil pusher (Mr. Dinkleberg works there as well). When he was a kid, the other kids used to call him Dad. He fell in love with Mom when they were kids and he fell in love with her again at Dimmsdale University in the 1980’s. </p>

            <h3>Mom</h3>
            <div class="charac_image">
                <img src="images/mom.png">
            </div>
            <p>Mrs. Turner also referred to as Mom, is the mother of Timmy and the wife of Mr. Turner. She is addressed by everyone as Mom, Timmy's Mom or Mrs. Turner. Mom is the dim-witted mother of Timmy. Her parents, Vlad and Gladys, are originally from a country called Ustinkistan. She and Mr. Turner have known each other since they were kids, but she originally dated his nemesis, Sheldon Dinkleberg, who broke up with her once he got rich. </p>
        
            <h3>Jorgen</h3>
            <div class="charac_image">
                <img src="images/jorgen.png">
            </div>
            <p>Jorgen Von Strangle is the strongest and toughest fairy in Fairy World, and is the commander of the Fairy godparents, but not of all the fairy world (because the Fairy Council probably commands more than him), although the extent of how powerful or how much he commands is not exactly clear. When Jorgen was first introduced, he was more of an enemy of Timmy, and in a few cases tried to get Timmy's godparents taken away. He often took great pleasure in harassing everyone around him. As the show went on, Jorgen seemed to warm up to Timmy, Cosmo and Wanda, and he has become more of an ally than an adversary. He even admitted that Cosmo, Wanda, and Timmy were his closest friends.</p>
